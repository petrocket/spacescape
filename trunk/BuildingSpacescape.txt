Spacescape uses CMake as its build system on all supported platforms.

CMake is a cross-platform build system/configurator availabe from http://www.cmake.org
You need a CMake version >=2.8

Create a build directory for Spacescape somewhere outside Spacescape's sources.  This is
the directory where CMake will create the build system for your chosen platform and
compiler.

Run the cmake-gui program and in the field 'Where is the source code' enter the path to 
the Spacescape source directory (the directory which contains this file).  In the field 
'Where to build the binaries' enter the path to the build directory you created.

Hit 'Configure' and select a platform and compiler, then click 'Finish'.

At this point you can change build option settings or fix errors for required libraries 
that have not been found. After you make any changes hit 'Configure' again.

When you are happy with the settings hit 'Generate' and CMake will create the build 
system for you. 

Go to your chosen build directory and open the solution/project file and compile away!
